Comments: I got different speeds in the Sphere tests when I changed the compiler, also some of my code only worked on the older "3.0" compiler, so I removed that code to allow it to compile on both versions. This made my code slightly slower in the long run. (about .15 seconds slower on V2)

I attest that I have written every line of code that I have submitted
and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted.
In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the
grader.
